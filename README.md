Kestrel is a multi-agent cognitive architecture for automating cybersecurity operations. It addresses the critical challenge of alert fatigue and analyst burnout by acting as a tireless, autonomous Tier 1-2 security analyst that can investigate, contextualize, and report on threats 24/7.

---

## 🏛️ Core Architecture

Kestrel employs a "supervisor-specialist" multi-agent system to divide and conquer complex security tasks. A central Orchestrator and Meta-Agent delegate tasks to specialized agents who use domain-specific tools to execute human-defined playbooks.

✨ Key Features
Multi-Agent System: Utilizes a supervisor (MetaAgent) to delegate tasks to specialist agents (SecOpsAgent, IAM_Agent), ensuring the right expertise is applied to every problem.
Playbook-Driven Orchestration: Executes investigations based on structured, human-defined YAML playbooks, ensuring consistent, auditable, and expert-guided analysis.
Domain-Specific Tooling: Comes equipped with a modular toolkit organized across the 8 domains of cybersecurity, allowing for targeted and effective actions.
Cognitive Memory: Leverages a vector database to maintain both short-term context for ongoing investigations and long-term memory of past incidents, improving its reasoning over time.
Structured Data Models: Enforces rigorous data validation using Pydantic models for all objects (alerts, assets, identities), reducing errors and improving reliability.
Modular and Extensible: Designed from the ground up to be easily extended with new connectors, tools, agents, and playbooks.
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.11+
Git
Poetry (recommended) or pip for dependency management
Installation & Configuration
Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/kestrel-intelligence-framework.git](https://github.com/your-username/kestrel-intelligence-framework.git)
cd kestrel-intelligence-framework




Set up a virtual environment:
Bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate




Install dependencies:
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
# Or using Poetry
# poetry install




Configure your environment:
Bash
cp .env.example .env


Now, edit the .env file to add your API keys and service credentials (e.g., for your SIEM, VirusTotal, OpenAI/Anthropic, etc.).
▶️ Usage
To run an analysis on a specific alert from your SIEM, you can trigger the main entry point:
Bash
python main.py --source siem --alert-id "INC0123456"


This command instructs Kestrel to use the SIEM connector to fetch the specified alert and begin the triage and investigation process defined in the playbook registry. The agent's progress and findings will be logged to the console and/or specified log files.
📂 Project Structure
The framework is organized as a professional Python package for maximum clarity and maintainability.
